HOTEL MANAGAMENT is the main file
The main file contains the code for hotel management system, and it needs to add the rooms file to the location where the main file will reside because file handling is used in the main code, 
and the main code will look for rooms.txt. If it doesn't find rooms.txt, an error will occur.
