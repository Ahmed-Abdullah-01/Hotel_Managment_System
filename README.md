The main file, HOTEL MANAGEMENT 🏨, contains the core code for the hotel management system. This main file requires the addition of a file named rooms.txt 📄 in the same directory where the main file resides. The main code includes file handling operations and will look for rooms.txt to retrieve necessary data about the hotel rooms 🛏️. If rooms.txt is not found, the program will encounter an error ⚠️, disrupting the system’s functionality. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that rooms.txt is present in the specified location to maintain smooth operation of the hotel management system.
